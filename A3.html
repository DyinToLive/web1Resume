                            Ability to lead on collaborative projects and guide colleagues to succeed as well; Built a website in HTML about the emerging tech scene in Calgary. My colleague was unsure of where to start so I took the initiative to buy a domain for the website, chose the content of the website, and helped him in areas of HTML that he was unsure of. The domain was an extra step so I can build on the website on my spare time and implement it at some point in the future; the idea came to me when someone asked about the emerging tech scene in Calgary and if there was a website. The first implementations of the website did not go as planned, but there is something to work toward and look forward to!

                     Finish carpenter - Worked with tools and material to make homes look better aesthetically; Carpentry involves solving problems with the tools and material that you have. An example of this would be doing a built-in closet. Every closet is a different size, and the design of a closet is done on site in a timely manner. Iâ€™m hopeful that these skills will translate to my career in technology.
